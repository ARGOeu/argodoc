row_description: [ "At its core, ARGO uses a flexible monitoring engine, a powerful analytics engine and a high performance API.<br/><br/>

Embracing a modular, pluggable architecture, ARGO can easily support a wide range of architectures.<br/><br/>

Out of the box: connectors for POEM, GOCDB, BDII and Gstat.
" ," ARGO Monitoring Engine can publish monitoring results in real time to any message broker service, which supports the STOMP or AMQP protocol.  <br/><br/>
Monitoring result collectors can listen on the message broker service,  retrieve the results and forward them to the compute engine.",
"<strong>Metric profiles </strong><br/> define which metrics are relevant for a specific type of service<br/>
<strong>Multiple Topologies</strong><br/> can describe simple and complex infrastructures<br/>
<strong>Multiple Availability Profiles</strong><br/> for flexible definition of business logic<br/>
<strong>Support of downtimes</strong><br/> allows us to define whether a service is supposed to be unavailable or not? <br/>
<strong>Custom factors</strong><br/> because not all services have the same importance from SG B <br/>
<strong>White listing</strong> of monitoring sources<br/>
<strong>Re-computations</strong> on demand"]
