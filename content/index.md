row_description: [ "At its core, ARGO uses a flexible distributed monitoring engine built around Nagios, a powerful analytics engine and a high performance API service.<br/><br/>

Embracing a modular, pluggable architecture, ARGO can easily support a wide range of architectures." ," ARGO Monitoring Engine can publish monitoring results in real time to any message broker service, which support the STOMP or AMQP protocol.  <br/><br/>
Monitoring result collectors can listen on the message broker service, retrieve the results.",
"<strong>A/R consumer</strong>: tap and listen to the Message Broker Network gather relevant messages able to manage and keep relevant fields on each message deliver data to the A/R Compute Engine
<br/><br/>
<strong>Sync components</strong>: topology information established grouping of services various weight information regarding grouping downtime information computation profiles ...also deliver data to the A/R Compute Engine"]
